# An engineer's view on the philosophy of science

## Motivation
In present days there's a more apparent, heated public debate about the general credibility of science. Pseudoscientific and anti-scientific movements seem to gain momentum, and while anti-vax movements had already started causing very real harm, with the coronavirus pandemic the potential risks of scientific illiteracy and misconceptions increased drastically.

Educated intellectuals with good knowledge about the history and philosophy of science also enter this discussion, pointing to real weaknesses of science.

In my opinion, most of these discussions, and the current discussions of philosophy and history of science seem to miss a very important point. The battle between critics and proponents of science argue about areas that are irrelevant to whether we, as a society, should base our decisions on scientific knowledge or not.

## What is science?
A key lesson from studying the history of science is that the very definition of science changes over time. Today's definitions include 'organizing knowledge' and 'testable predictions' among many other terms that definitely didn't apply a thousand years ago.

How do we even talk about the history of science, then, if there's no single, age-independent definition of it? Common history and philosophy of science takes it natural that the natural philosophy of Aristotle or Descartes are parts of the past of science, that there's a certain continuity between today's science and Aristotle's philosophy. Why is that?

There's a very good reason to assume this continuity. All these efforts try to answer a question about the true nature of reality:

> What is the world around us? How does it work?

I, however, think that we can have a very different philosophy and history of science if we focus on a different question:

> How can we obtain practically applicable knowledge about the world around us?

If we take this question as a backbone, the history of science takes a different turn around the scientific revolution: it goes back to early engineering and craft.

I'll refer to these approaches as the _'philosophical perspective' and the _'engineering perspective'_.  (Note that the word 'engineering' shouldn't be taken too strictly here, this is just the best word I could find here. I'll elaborate on this later.)

## The engineering perspective on the history of science
Let me give you a short overview on _how I imagine_ the engineering perspective on the history of science, how it is different from the philosophical perspective.

### Aristotle
History of science is generally started from Aristotle. In his philosophy, _episteme_ and _techne_ were intentionally separated and a good theory of natural philosophy could not, almost by definition, be practically applicable.

While the philosophy of Aristotle is often praised from the philosophical perspective, as Steven Weinberg also expresses in 'To Explain the World', there was almost nothing it was actually right about and it was not practically applicable [Weinberg].

In the age of ancient Greece there were, though, already wonderful technical creations of humankind, and many of the foundations of today's science were already incorporated in the processes that helped create them. Measurements, quantification, experimentation and repeatability were already essential in very basic applications of engineering, even if they weren't necessarily applied consciously.

Historians of science should rather discuss Archimedes instead of Aristotle.

In case you missed, Archimedes was not only famous for allegedly measuring the purity of a crown. The Claw of Archimedes for example was used to sink enemy ships assaulting Syracuse. He also built giant parabolic mirrors that reflected the sun to set enemy sails on fire. And the list goes on. He used practically applicable knowledge about how the world around us works. He might have not expressed a theory of optics, but we very likely did calculations using quantitative formulae, predicted outcomes and aligned his formalae to match observations. Go look up these in Youtube, Mythbusters and other guys were recreating these to see if these could actually work as legend has them, they are truly awesome!

### The scientific revolution
During the scientific revolution the philosophical and the engineering approaches to pursuing knowledge about our world met. Natural philosophy started to incorporate practices that are today considered the foundation of modern science: experimentations, quantification, mathematization.

In my opinion, the advancement of engineering played an indispensable role in this. More and more advanced equipment allowed for more and more precise measurements about celestial bodies as well as terrestrial ones. These increasingly precise measurements made the anomalies in planetary motion more apparent, it allowed Galilei to measure the effects of gravitational acceleration, and it made advancements in optics possible.

If I want to strictly separate the two interpretations of this era, I could say:
* From the philosophical perspective, natural philosophy turned to applying practically verifiable theories.
* From the engineering perspective, the increasingly precise measurements allowed engineers to formulate increasingly abstract theories.

These two approaches, of course, shouldn't be separated this strictly. Probably most of the great scientists of the era of the scientific revolution were more motivated by philosophy than practical applicability. I don't know whether Newton, for example, was more motivated by some engineering problems he had when he worked on mechanics, or we were rather wondering about how the universe works. Maybe both.

On the other hand, people had always been wondering about nature, but it's the advancement in practical engineering and technology that made the progress possible, and it's probably the advancement in technology that found natural phenomena that couldn't be integrated to existing natural philosophies.

Of course, these are very simplistic interpretations of the wonderful thing that happened during the scientific revolution. The point I'm trying to make here is just that the current historical narrative of science is biased towards the philosophical perspective, and this way, it misses the most important thing about today's science.


The practices that science started to pick up during the scientific revolution were already well established in engineering (quantitative measurements, using mathematical formulae, etc), thus it's well justifiable to take the history of these engineering practices as part of the history of science.

These practices already proved to be important in reliably creating all kinds of products. As natural philosophy adopted these principles, it also started to create theories that are practically applicable.

### Modern science
Today, many scientists are definitely still striving to unravel the true nature of reality. On the contrary, the “Shut up and calculate” approach in quantum mechanics (attributed to David Mermin) somehow acknowledges that the true nature of reality might not even be humanly conceivable, but we can still gain practical knowledge. As Allan Adams from MIT points out [Adams]:

> Physics doesn't tell you some abstract truth about why the universe is the way it is. Physics gives you models to understand how things work and predict what will happen next. [...]

> Physics doesn't tell you what's true. Physics doesn't tell you what a priori did the world have to look like. Physics tells you this is a good model, and it works really well, and it fits the data. And to the degree that it doesn't fit the data, it's wrong.

Striving to understand absolute truths has probably been a motivation in scientists that led to many important discoveries. Today, however, it seems to be increasingly well understood that understanding the true nature of reality might just not be possible at all. Fallibilism poses very solid points here. With today's technological advancements it's also somewhat commonly known that we might live in a simulation, and if the simulation is good enough, we'll never know. We might even just be the dream of a galactic turtle in some other universe.

But does this render the mission of science futile and its discoveries useless?

Definitely not.

The engineering approach focuses on the practical applicability of scientific theories, so at the end, we'll have something that everyone can objectively agree on: the news coming from the radio, the water boiling on the stove, the lack of money on our balances at the end of the month, the death of a patient. This objective outcome will be independent of whether the applied theory is true in any absolute sense.

## Practically applicable
I tried to define the engineering perspective as focusing on practically applicable knowledge.

In this perspective this doesn't necessarily mean that the theory must have applications that are actually out there in the real world. While quantum mechanics and general relativity are literally working at our hands when we navigate with GPS on our mobile phones, there are other discoveries that don't, or don't yet have effects on our everyday lives.

The distinction here is that if a theory of subatomic particles wouldn't have any predictions that are quantifiably falsifiable by experiment, we wouldn't have a way to construct anything based on that theory, even if that theory would be the way how the world really works.

Let's consider for example a physical theory that's currently very exotic, and its effects are only measurable in expensive experiments lasting several years with particle accelerators. The measurement data coming from such an experiment is a practical outcome. Performing such a vast experiment to produce some measurement outcome is a practical application.

For the theory of evolution by natural selection for example, selective breeding is a practical application. Discussion on the theory of evolution can easily be confusing. In the metaphysical sense we are striving to answer how we as humans and other creatures around us came to be. From the engineering perspective we don't really care if the world was indeed created a few thousand years ago by God. From the engineering perspective it doesn't even matter if currently existing species really evolved, or if some of them were artificially created by extraterrestrials. We see evolution happening around us all the time, we can see evolution happening in vitro, and we can use the predictions of the theory.

I would like to also make a distinction from _technoscience_. As far as I understood, technoscience focuses on technology, regarding actual technological applications, and its relation to philosophical science. In my definition of _engineering perspective_, we don't focus on technology only, or actual technological applications, or the inner workings of technological practice itself. The key here is the separation of the metaphysical and practical implications of scientific theories, and this can safely involve theories that will never have technological implications, for example social sciences.

## Engineering as science
Most commonly mentioned properties of scientific theories are that they provide quantifiable  predictions and they are falsifiable by experiment. These criteria are actually essential for a theory to be also applicable in engineering: the experiment conducted to verify a prediction of the theory is a very practical thing. It might or might not be actually useful in any sense, but often it's just a question of time until engineers find a way for a useful practical application of the predicted phenomena.

From this aspect, all kinds of practical knowledge can be regarded as scientific theories. Our ancestors discovered that sharp bits of stones can cut bones open. Strictly speaking, whether a bone is open or not, is a quantifiable outcome. The theory here is that 'sharp stones break bones open'. Some ancient theorist could then wonder, could sharp bits of wood also break bones open? This is a theory of the same kind, and it's falsifiable by experiment. Sharp wood probably doesn't break bones open, at least not the bones that our ancestors couldn't already open by hand or teeth.

Less ancient engineers then worked with similarly simple, but more quantified theories. Roman builders worked with a specific mix of ingredients for their cement used in construction. Certain amounts of certain ingredients result in a sufficiently solid material. Mixing it in other ratios results in less solid or less durable material. I don't know if they ever quantifiably measured and documented the solidity and durability of their cement pieces, but even if these outcomes were never translated to and written numbers, builders somehow tracked which mixing ratios are better.

### Fields of applicability
Engineers are also very well used to the fact that theories have a limited field of applicability. The world shaked when _“Einstein proved Newton wrong”_ with a new theory of gravity. What did engineers do?

> When reading the news headlines, the engineering director picked up the phone and called the chief engineer:
> - Hey, John, how are you? Do you think our engineering projects involve relativistic speeds or masses?
> - No, Sir.
> - Ok, thank you, have a great day!
>
> And that was it.

Engineering usually works with acceptable approximations, and while it's useful to know the underlying general rules that govern the world, engineering uses practical abstractions and approximations for specific use cases.

Public interpretations of scientific theories often present theories as universally true. Induction is inherently problematic, as fallibilism rightfully points it out. When Newton formulated the laws of mechanics, many philosophers and scientists started to assume that everything in the world is governed by these laws, and the notion of a mechanical universe was accepted. Induction probably got a bit too far. When the theories of relativity showed that there are important limitations to Newton's laws, and that these laws are just good approximations of a more general theory, many argued whether Newton's theories were falsified.

To engineers, this question is very simple. To practically apply Newton's laws of mechanics, engineers don't have to _inductively assume_ anything about the true boundaries of the field of applicability of these laws. Engineers already work with more everyday limitations of certain theories.

### Applications of theories
You might remember from high school physics when you had to identify the forces involved in certain mechanical configurations. A key part in successfully applying Newton's laws of motion is knowing how to _bridge_ reality to the theoretical elements. I would say, this knowledge is just as important as the theory itself.

For a funny example, `F = m * a`, or rather `a = F / m` generally lets us calculate the acceleration of a body given its mass and the force applied on it. We have to be careful though to know what is mass, what is a force and what can be treated as a body. When calculating the displacement of a liftarm, engineers will readily apply these laws. When applying a certain force to a duck, engineers will already know that simply calculating `a = F / m` won't necessarily yield a proper result, because a duck is not a rigid body, and the deformation of the duck will dissipate energy of the motion in internal friction, and the overall acceleration will be less. Most engineers will also know that there's no such thing as a perfectly rigid body. (Let's note that to some extent, internal friction can also be modelled by a Newtonian model of smaller, interacting rigid bodies, but this modelling breaks down as we enter the realm of chemistry and ultimately quantum mechanics).

After all, engineers won't panic if new limits of applicability are discovered of a theory that is otherwise already very successfully applied in practice.

### Processes
It's not only the acceptance criteria for theories that resemble engineering principles, but the processes used in science can also be often found in engineering processes. Using peer review is very common practice for most software developers. _Repeatability_ and _reproducibility_ are also commonly found in many fields of engineering. I recently also wrote a [smaller article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ3bPUKo5zc ) about how the principles in science are also applied in software engineering.

In the philosophy of science, the practices and processes applied by scientific communities are also heatedly debated. Many argue whether these practices ensure or increase the correctness of resulting theories. Some say that many of the official practices of certain fields aren't actually employed. In other cases, practices change as new theories or new paradigms arise. Philosophers then argue on what basis do scientists insist on these processes.

From my perspective, as an engineer, I look at these practices and processes as a collection of _best practices_. I really don't see any universal truth in them. Medicine has found that the placebo effect can make drugs falsely seem efficient, so they established the practice of placebo-controlled trials. The key of a placebo-controlled trial is in the details, researchers have to know how to apply it well in their respective fields. Placebo-controlled trials aren't universally necessary. If it would become somehow possible to fully model and/or observe certain drug effects, the practices in drug testing will probably drastically change.

It's all like:
> Hey, we've made this mistake, let's try to make sure we don't do it again.

The problem with many unscientific approaches is not that scientific processes are something divine and unquestionable and they must be unquestionably followed. The problem with unscientific approaches is that their practitioners don't show that they've understood the problems that these processes try to address and they are addressing them somehow, or try to show why they don't need to be addressed.

On the other hand, many engineers argue that there are no _best practices_. There are problems and then there are solutions to those problems. This also means that we really think there's no such thing as an universal best practice. Practitioners in all fields of science will study and discuss their current and past mistakes and difficulties, and try to adapt their practices to better serve their goals. There doesn't need to be anything universal or philosophical about these practices.

## Relation to philosophy
I found many philosophical discussions that treat natural philosophy as an 'early version' of physics. Tracking the continuity of physics back to natural philosophy only holds reasonable if we assume that physics is trying to answer absolute truths about the universe, that is, we take the _philosophical perspective_.

### Interpretations
Pointing to the way Allan Adams expressed it (see above), today's physics is admittedly not metaphysical.

This can be confusing at first, because many physicists are often talking about metaphysics, and the way physics is actually presented naturally works with metaphysical objects. But these _interpretations_ of the physical theories are not inherently part of those theories, they are just a necessary means for us humans to think and talk about them.

A clear example of this is how competing _interpretations_ of quantum mechanics exist. The _Copenhagen interpretation_ and the _many-worlds_ or _multiverse interpretation_ are the most commonly publicly discussed. The actual physics is the same behind both of these, and they involve the same calculations and yield the same predictions. They are, of course, ontologically very different, and they have fundamentally different metaphysical consequences, but they are not _inherently_ part of quantum mechanics.

For a more simple example, let's consider Newton's law of gravitation. Hakob et al [Hakob] argues that the metaphysical notion of action at a distance is a natural consequence of Newton's law, thus _action at a distance_ was part of the Newtonian mosaic. A physical law, however, only has metaphysical consequences if we have the philosophical perspective. From the engineering perspective, we don't have to make such assumptions. We can safely use Newton's law of gravitation the same way for calculating the orbits of celestial bodies without assuming that action at a distance is truly a part of our reality. While our calculations inherently assume an action at a distance, we can still be agnostic about how that action actually happens. Maybe that force is mediated through some local forces, we just cannot (yet) observe that. Following Occam's razor, we don't include unnecessary unobservables in the theories, but that doesn't mean we are completely sure that those unobservables don't exist.

This transition in the separation of physics and metaphysics looks like a reversal of what happened before and during the scientific revolution. As with increasingly precise measurements the orbits of celestial bodies showed more and more anomalies with existing models, people started to treat new cosmological models as just useful tools for calculations, but not as actual descriptions of the way the universe works [Weinberg]. A preamble explaining this was forcibly added to Galileo's work. Later people started to accept that these new models are really describing how the universe works. Today it seems we are back to the time of Galileo where we have to be cautious about the distinction of useful predictions and absolute truths.

Were people at the time of Galileo right? I wouldn't say so - at least in the sense that the theories of cosmology they proposed have really no solid basis. But after all, we really cannot know if there are angels holding planets in their orbits, they are just doing it in a way that those orbits perfectly match the predictions of general relativity, to the extent that we can meaningfully measure.

From the _engineering perspective_, though, this all doesn't really matter. The objective predictions of these theories keep improving, seemingly regardless of what metaphysical interpretations we bind to them.

Is there any relevance of metaphysics in science then, if we focus on the engineering perspective? From this perspective it really looks like that metaphysical interpretations of advances in science are just lagging behind as people naturally try to make sense of the world around them. People are always trying to answer questions that are part of the philosophical perspective, and they have to regularly re-adjust these views to better incorporate, or not to contradict new scientific discoveries.

Metaphysical views certainly play an important role in giving people a framework for discussions, even between scientists.

But do they contribute to actual scientific advancement? I don't think I can answer this question. Weinberg argues that the igniting force for the scientific revolution was breaking up with pure philosophy and turning to experiments. Nevertheless, making a metaphysical sense of these theories might be indispensable in the thought processes that lead to the formulation of new theories, even though their metaphysical interpretations are not necessary for the final theories to be applicable.

Certain metaphysical preferences can also be considered as a good [guiding force for new discoveries](https://www.pnas.org/content/93/25/14256). Newton himself was admittedly dissatisfied with having to assume an action at a distance, and today's physicists also tend to be uncomfortable with the idea - they prefer the principle of _locality_.

In the engineering perspective, philosophical interpretations are just a necessary crutch for us humans.

### Realism
It can be often confusing for people that physicists are talking about things they can hardly observe as reality. They say “an electron was ejected and hit the detector screen”, or “gluons hold atomic nuclei together”.

They are, however, completely aware that they are not explaining reality in a metaphysical sense. They also often explain that when they say 'an electron is real' they only mean that assuming an electron with the given theories yields good predictions of phenomenae (see Allan Adams above for an example).

On the other hand, physicists are often _realists_. We have to be careful here, because the _principle of realism_ is different from realism as in the philosophy of science. Realism in physics is a principle that assumes that there's an objective reality that is independent from ourselves. Realism in the philosophy of science also often claims that scientific theories can be considered genuinely true. The important difference here is that the principle of realism can be applied in physics without stating anything about our current theories of physics, or even assuming that we can ever possibly genuinely describe reality.

In physics, the _instrumentalist_ approach says that all our theories and theoretical entities like electrons or gluons are rather just tools to help with our calculations to predict outcomes.

I might seem to take an instrumentalist approach here by emphasising that we should focus on practical outcomes, not the theories. But I'm not saying that these theories are wrong or not important. I just say that the practical outcomes are the most important thing. In what sense are these theories real, or they are just tools, is still an interesting and important question. I just think it's not fundamental.

## Relativism, constructivism and other thoughts
While reading books about the philosophy of science, I often found that many of the ongoing arguments and debates simply vanish if we don't take the philosophical view on science.

There's an often quoted (and hardly pronounced) term: _incommensurability_. It roughly means theories from different paradigms in science are not really comparable or matchable. A common example is that while certain philosophers of science claim that Newton's law of gravity is an approximating edge-case of General Relativity, others argue that the involved ontologies fundamentally differ, and this way the purely mathematical similarity is misleading.

From an engineering perspective, what truly matter are the practical applications. And in the realm of practical applications Newton's laws are indeed an edge-case approximation of General Relativity, no matter how the associated philosophical paradigms have different views on the term mass, for example.

Proponents of incommensurability also argue that if Niels Bohr were to talk with Aristotle about the atom, they would hardly understand each other, and very probably Aristotle would dismiss Bohr's approach. I think this comparison is just mistaken. We should get Bohr to drink tea with Archimedes, not with Aristotle. Bohr could likely help Archimedes sink Aristotle's ship with a giant claw.

There are also discussions about the progressivity of science. Some philosophers started arguing that the progression of scientific theories is cumulative in the sense that new theories also explain phenomena explained by previous theories, but they explain more phenomena. Others then point out that this was not always true, and in certain cases the new theory didn't explain some phenomena the old one did. Philosophers try to somehow measure progress in terms of explanatory power. In my view, what matters is the range of practical applications. New theories usually come with new potential applications. If new theories don't explain or predict some phenomena that the previous one did, engineers can still use the old theory for designing products that rely on that phenomena. Utilizing even directly contradicting theories is not a problem at all, given that each has their own fields of applicability where they have proven to be reliably applicable. After all, General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are fundamentally incompatible, the clocks in GPS satellites can still be fine-tuned to account for the time-dilation due to gravity and speed.

## Caveats
This 'engineering approach' of science, of course, may not be well applicable to all aspects of the philosophy of science.

### Demarcation criteria
The demarcation criteria, for example, is used to decide what's taught in schools, what's researched in universities. Funding only those fields of research that imaginably yield practical applications is an often criticized approach, because it's commonly understood how fundamental research paves the way for more practical studies in the future.

In my opinion, the criteria for theories to be considered scientific already ensure that there's at least a faint connection to practical reality.

### Objective outcomes
Throughout the discussion I vaguely referred to _practical applicability_ and _objective outcomes_. These can be way more tricky to properly define that it first looks, and a lot can depend on these definitions.

As I mentioned, in my point of view a _practical application_ doesn't really need to be useful in any everyday sense, but it needs to involve some sort of a physical state change. I can vaguely say that a practical outcome is something that can kill you, but as the definition of death can be problematic, let's go with a single LED light. If there's any kind of physical state change, we can tweak the experiment to turn on that tiny light based on that state.

I also mention _objective outcomes_, and this might seem even more problematic. For an extreme example, some spiritual teachers might claim that by deep meditation they discover hidden truths about the universe, and that you can also personally experience this by sufficient practice. They would say that what's objective to you, is subjective according to them, and seeing a LED light is also just a subjective experience.

I think we can safely just ignore this problem. We can look at science as something that produces practically applicable knowledge _for those who can agree on whether a LED is lit or not_. Do we miss the ultimate source of knowledge by being involved in a collective psychosis that makes us believe in objective realities? Maybe.

## Can science be trusted?
Critics of science today tend to point on fallibilism and relativism to question the credibility of science, while proponents point to all the great things science has discovered. These arguments hardly meet, and in my opinion this is due to the different perspectives they take, so after all, they are not talking about the same thing. On the other hand, proponents of science often point to achievements in physics while trying to defend science in completely other fields.

I think there's a true difference in the soundness of certain scientific theories. Even if widely accepted scientific theories truly meet the acceptance criteria of their respective fields, I would say that the true soundness of a theory is given by its practical applications.

We've seen for example that Newton's theory of gravity can safely be used even if we know it to be wrong. You might also remember from highschool that in electronics we generally assume that positive charges move in wires. That notation originates from early experiments with electricity, when science was quite far from understanding atoms and electromagnetism. We now know that usually it's electrons that move, but scientists have decided not to change the notations, because usually it doesn't practically matter. The calculations work just fine assuming that positive charges move in the opposite direction. There are other cases when it matters how certain electronic components work on the quantum level, and in this case it will matter how electrons behave. Electric engineers know in detail the proper _fields of applicability_ of the involved theories.

As a contrast, I would say that certain theories in cosmology are much less sound. Many of these theories don't (yet) have practical applications and this way, if new evidence emerges and they need to be replaced, they get fully discarded. The general public often interprets this kind of progressivity in science as uncertainty, and present it as a proof of its unreliability. Similarly, we might never be completely sure if certain dinosaurs had feathers, if certain species truly flew or not, or what caused the cambrian explosion. Are these fields unscientific then? Certainly not. As all fields of science, these fields also strive to learn from mistakes and they incorporate their lessons in their processes and practices. They cumulate our best way of gaining knowledge about the given topic so far.

## History of practical knowledge
One might accuse me of thinking that philosophy is not practical, but I wholeheartedly agree that the questions that today's philosophy of science addresses have very real and very important effects on our everyday lives.

Researching the 'engineering approach' for the history of science, however, could yield other kinds of important observations. While the current scientific methods have proved to be very successful in gaining applicable knowledge, this scientific method might not be the only one, even if it might be the most powerful.

Instead of discussing how theories are accepted and discarded, or what leads to ultimately true theories, researchers of science could focus on what leads to practically applicable theories.

I might also be accused of taking a selective and biased look at the course of history of science. I would say that other philosophers also do so when they track the roots of science to Aristotle. Their arguments then pose good critique on science as a means to find out truths, but not on science as finding reliably applicable knowledge - and this latter is what gains science its position and importance in today's society.

## Other discussions
I'm, of course, not the first to propose a similar approach. See for example:

* “I tend to view natural science as in the business of controlling and predicting things, and as largely useless for philosophical purposes” ([Rorty - “Reply to Hartshorne,” Saatkamp, 32](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rorty/#2))
* “Furthermore, Rescher's aim is to replace Charles S. Peirce's “long-run convergence” theory of scientific progress by a more modest position geared to increasing success in scientific applications, especially in matters of prediction and control." - [an introduction about Rersher](https://iep.utm.edu/rescher/#H8).
* I also found Larry Laudan's work very inspiring as he argues about relativist philosophy. [Laudan]

I still, somehow, felt that the point I tried to make above isn't expressed sufficiently clearly, and isn't really represented in public discussions about the philosophy of science.

## Looking forward
I heard many critiques of science invoking fallibilism and relativism against science, while we all sit in our cars and use our mobile phones to navigate to the dentist to fill a root cavity, asking for lidocaine - we literally trust and verify most of physics, chemistry, biology and medicine in our daily routine. The fact that our knowledge might not be the ultimate truth, or that even the current scientific practices are not the best we could have, doesn't really matter much here.

The latest years have shown us how the general public's understanding and trust in science is crucial whether it comes to pandemics, fighting climate change, or creating a sustainable agriculture and economy in general. It's important for all of us to understand how and what can science contribute to our lives and our future.
